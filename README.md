# StreakP

[Visit page](http://katkelemen.pythonanywhere.com/login/?next=/goal/24/)

The main focus of this project is developing my Python and Django skills. 

StreakP is an unfinished web application, where people can set daily goals for themselves.

The app helps people remain motivated by:
- Creating a streak, which is cleared when skipping a day
- Credits can be obtained by accomplishing certain checkpoints in the streak
- Erasing streak can be avoided by cashing credits
- Option for sending reminder email about uncompleted daily goals (using [mandrill app](https://mandrillapp.com/))

The idea is based on [Jerry Seinfeld's productivity secret](http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret)
